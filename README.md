# Healthcare Analytics Dashboard - Excel Project

## Overview
This project analyzes healthcare data to derive actionable insights for improved patient care and resource allocation. The dataset includes details about patient admissions, readmissions, and departmental operations.

## Dataset Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from a publicly available Kaggle repository. It includes various details about patient demographics, admission details, and readmission statuses.

## Steps Taken
1. Obtained the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Cleaned the data in Excel, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
3. Binned age groups and calculated midpoints for analysis.
4. Created pivot tables and various charts (pie chart, bar charts, line chart) to visualize the data.
5. Analyzed the findings to provide insights into readmission rates, total admissions by department, and age distribution of patients.

## Visualizations
1. Total Admissions by Department
2. Admissions & Readmissions by Department
3. Readmission Rate by Department (Pie Chart)
4. Admissions by Age Group (Line Chart)

## Analysis and Findings
- High Readmission Rate in the Surgery department
- Effective treatment in the age group 41-50 with high non-readmissions
- Resource allocation needs in Gynecology due to high total admissions

## Conclusion
The dashboard highlights key areas for improving patient care and resource management, providing actionable insights for healthcare providers.
